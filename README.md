# HayesOverdrive
A free, open-source audio plugin that can apply various operations to distort the incoming signal.
Users can interact with input and output from the overdrive, giving them control over the amount of overdrive applied to their signal,
as well as the gain of the final result. Also included is a Bias knob, which emulates the characteristics of different types of Diodes in an analog circuit.
